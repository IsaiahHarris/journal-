        <h2>UX vs UI</h2>

          <h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
          <p>
            UX stands for user experience, it is the users experience while using something such as technology or even like a door. is there is a door with no handle, you will probably have bad UX. Good UX is when the user is happy.
          </p>
          <p>
          UI stands for user interface. user interface is what the user sees. good user interface is usually colorful or neat. bad user interface is very messy and hard for the user to understand. bad UI could lead to bad UX.

        <h2>Digimon Go</h2>
        <h6> 10/7/16</h6>
          <p>Digimon Go project or assignment really opened my eyes to how to do everything we learned so far. After school when i worked on it for some reason a lightbulb went off in my head and i got the connection from the html and css. Even thoiugh it was really easy it just gave me a better understanding of everything that we learned </p>

        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <h6>10/7/16</h6>
          <p>Responsive web design is when the web design "flows" with the size of the screen. That means when the user makes the window smaller you can still see all of the content. such as the block family assignment that we did, i had 9 blocks in rows of 3 but when i made the window smaller on my website i could still see 9 blocks</p>

        <h2>media queries</h2> 
        <h6>10/7/16</h6>
            <p> media queries is to change the browser content based on the size of the screen or window so like if the scren goes from small to large it could changve color or something. its a part of responsive design and it adds to the flow of the page and stuff.

          <h2>basic java script</h2>
          <h6>11/2/16</h6>
            <p>We learned about camelCase and camel case is so theres no spaces but you can tell when the word ends because theres a capital. variables are values that you can set for later use and you can use it later for console.logs, console logs are commands if the statments are true according to the variables. functions are when you run something and something comes and it uses variables and console logs.

          <h2>conditional statements</h2>
          <h6>11/2/16</h6>
            <p>conditional statements use if, else if and else. you could set blue aliens to 500 and red aliens to 500 and say a conditional statement, if red aliens + blue aliens = 1000 console.log oh my god. The statement would run true because 500 + 500 is a 1000. console log is like the end result if the conditional statement is true according to the variables. conditional statments are like simon says, if this is true then do this.
