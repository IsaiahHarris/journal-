          <h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
          <p>
            UX stands for user experience, it is the users experience while using something such as technology or even like a door. is there is a door with no handle, you will probably have bad UX. Good UX is when the user is happy.
          </p>
          <p>
          UI stands for user interface. user interface is what the user sees. good user interface is usually colorful or neat. bad user interface is very messy and hard for the user to understand. bad UI could lead to bad UX.
