        <h2>UX vs UI</h2>
        <h6>August 24, 2016</h6>
        <div class="article">
          <h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
          <p>
            UX stands for user experience, it is the users experience while using something such as technology or even like a door. is there is a door with no handle, you will probably have bad UX. Good UX is when the user is happy.
          </p>
          <p>
          UI stands for user interface. user interface is what the user sees. good user interface is usually colorful or neat. bad user interface is very messy and hard for the user to understand. bad UI could lead to bad UX.

        <h2>Digimon Go</h2>
        <h6> 10/7/16</h6>
          <p>Digimon Go project or assignment really opened my eyes to how to do everything we learned so far. After school when i worked on it for some reason a lightbulb went off in my head and i got the connection from the html and css. Even thoiugh it was really easy it just gave me a better understanding of everything that we learned </p>

        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <h6>10/7/16</h6>
          <p>Responsive web design is when the web design "flows" with the size of the screen. That means when the user makes the window smaller you can still see all of the content. such as the block family assignment that we did, i had 9 blocks in rows of 3 but when i made the window smaller on my website i could still see 9 blocks</p>

        <h2>media queries</h2> 
        <h6>10/7/16</h6>
            <p> media queries is to change the browser content based on the size of the screen or window so like if the scren goes from small to large it could changve color or something. its a part of responsive design and it adds to the flow of the page and stuff.

          <h2>basic java script</h2>
          <h6>11/2/16</h6>
            <p>We learned about camelCase and camel case is so theres no spaces but you can tell when the word ends because theres a capital. variables are values that you can set for later use and you can use it later for console.logs, console logs are commands if the statments are true according to the variables. functions are when you run something and something comes and it uses variables and console logs.

          <h2>conditional statements</h2>
          <h6>11/2/16</h6>
            <p>conditional statements use if, else if and else. you could set blue aliens to 500 and red aliens to 500 and say a conditional statement, if red aliens + blue aliens = 1000 console.log oh my god. The statement would run true because 500 + 500 is a 1000. console log is like the end result if the conditional statement is true according to the variables. conditional statments are like simon says, if this is true then do this.

          <h2>verizon app challenge</h2>
          <h6>11/28/16</h6>
            <p>the problem is that students may feel ashamed or may not have enough time to visit the councilors office or health room. this leads to students not getting the help the need. Our app solves this problem by geting rid of the trip/walk of shame to the office or health room. our app can schedule anonymous appointments with healthroom/councilors. i would improve my video by showing more how the app works but we dont have the app. I would also improve it by having better sound and a better camera to film with. Our features include chat rooms and phone directories. if you forget your appointment there are also reminders that you scheduled an appointment. the chat rooms are anonymous and you can have them with councilors etc. the features that my group would like to add are maybe voice messages or live video chat in case you are sent home from school and the nurse needs to check on you. i would also like to add a feature where we could that group chats. challenges that our team faced were transferring videos from my phone to alex over the weekend so she could edit it. i only could send her videos under 20mb so we had to edit it last minute. other challenges were finding time to film becasue everyone had things to do. i think next time it would be better to film and edit on the same persons devices so he or she can easily access the videos that were filmed. also we could make our video easier to film so we would have enough time, a simpler video.

          <h2>final journal reflection</h2>
          <h6>12/21/16</h6>
          <p>This semester I learned alot looking back. At first i did not know what the hell to do but during the last 4 weeks i was really starting to get it. In first quarter it was not fun at all but in second quarter it was kinda fun because i could actually dothe work without asking zak to help me every five seconds. My favorite thing about this semetser was conditional statments and mouse commands because i actually knew how to do the code and also it was fun. i think i did good this semester but next semester has to be better for me to get an A. I could improve next semester by doing my work on time and paying attention to every detail that the teacher is teaching. I think this would help me a lot because if i pay attention to the teacher, then i will know exactly what to do when i do my work and i wont be confused. Using w3 schools will probably help me alot because it shows you how to do most things but even then i get confused. Overall this semester i learned a lot of fun and cool stuff about coding but i don't think i will be taking coding 2.
